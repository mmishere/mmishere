### Hello!

My name's Maaheen Maajed, and I'm a student at UIUC. Alongside school, I'm currently working on the Cyberpunk 2020 DM Kit, among other things. I'm interested in internships in Software Engineering and Development, and I work on both backend and frontend software, as well as having experience with Full Stack Development. I'm experienced in Java, C++, Python, and Kotlin, as well as HTML and CSS.

On top of that, I've spent multiple semesters on the course staff of UIUC's Intro to CS class, where I help students in office hours and on the forum with object-oriented programming and Android development in Java and Kotlin.

More info on my [personal website](http://mmaajed.com/) as well.
